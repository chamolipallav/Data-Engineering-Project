# Data-Engineering-Project

In this Self-Learning Project i've practised with different sets of open source datasets and developed skills like.

In this Data Enginerring Project we explored 3NF Schema ER diagram and Created tables and populated the tables with data.

to improve the Query Analysis Time, we created STAR Schema of the Same 3NF DVD Rental Dataset. 
The Star Schema and the ER Diagram is below

and the 3NF Schema Diagrma is

The final Query Time Analysis Results of STAR SCHEMA was much faster than the 3NF. 

The main difference in results can be notes while working with large number of datasets.
